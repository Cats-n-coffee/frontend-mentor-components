# Frontend Mentor Component Challenges

This repository holds a couple of challenges from Frontend Mentor. Some of them are deployed, and some are not. They are exercises to practice HTML, CSS and Vanilla Js. <br>

## Pricing Toggle Component

This challenge was to pratice creating a toggle button. As I will learn about accessibility, the implementation of the toggle button will probably change. <br>

## Tip Calculator

The main focus was to create active states with user input. The disabled button needs revision, as it is being set using Js. The Js files were written to practice using event listeners with classes.<br>

## Challenges not deployed

The Profile Card Component and the Room Homepage are not deployed and the code needs revision.
